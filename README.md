# Mini-Terminal

C programme to implement a minor version of the shell. The programme should provide a prompt for the user to type the commands. In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).

Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.
Here we are implementing a minor version of shell in ubuntu using C.
                                        This shell version is based on Command-line interface shell. In this shell version we include:

•	DIR – This should list all the files in the current directory 
•	PWD – It should display the present working directory’s absolute path
•	JOB – This should display all the user level tasks which are currently running on the machine
•	NEWD – To create a new folder in the current directory. This command should be used with an argument which should be the name of the folder which needs to be created.
•	MATCH – To create search for a particular patter in a specific file. This command takes two arguments. First one is the file name and second one is the pattern.
•	EXIT – To exit from the shell.
•	HELP – To display all the commands which works in the new shell.
